/**
 * Compose the `/agent` replay slice: the REAL captured odds, read from MongoDB at request
 * time, joined to the REAL detector's output.
 *
 * The split matters, and the UI's honesty depends on it:
 *
 * * The **odds** — every `ts` and every `pct` — are read here, live, out of `odds_updates`.
 *   They used to be a checked-in JSON export, which worked on the capture machine and was
 *   invisible to a deploy. This is what makes the deployed page show real data.
 * * The **detector output** — the threshold, the readings observed, and which moves crossed —
 *   comes from {@link MANIFEST}, a ~1KB artifact written by the real Python `SharpDetector`
 *   over the whole capture. It is not recomputed here. Re-implementing the detector in
 *   TypeScript and calling the result "the real detector" would be a lie, and scanning all
 *   16,781 of the fixture's readings per request to redo it would be the wrong shape anyway.
 *
 * The two stay consistent because the series fetched is exactly the line the detector fired
 * on — same fixture, same market, same outcome — and {@link verifyMove} re-checks that the
 * flagged move's price is actually present in the readings that came back from Mongo.
 *
 * It is a RECORDED REPLAY either way. Serving it from a database does not make it live, and
 * nothing here may ever label it so.
