              When a match ends, the result arrives as a signed receipt from the
              sports-data provider. The program checks that receipt itself, on
              chain, and pays out automatically. If the receipt doesn&rsquo;t check
              out, nothing moves — nobody, including us, can change the outcome.

                For the technically curious: the receipt is a 3-stage Merkle proof,
                verified by TxODDS&rsquo;s on-chain oracle against its own committed
                root — a tampered proof reverts.
