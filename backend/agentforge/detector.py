"""Sharp-move detection — pure logic over typed odds snapshots.

No network, no feed dependency, no LLM. Given successive ``OddsSnapshot`` readings for a
fixture, the detector tracks each price line's implied probability and flags a *sharp move*
when that probability shifts past a threshold (percentage points) between readings. That
signal — which book, which market, which outcome, how far, which way — is what the decision
step turns into a bet.

``OddsSnapshot`` / ``PriceQuote`` are defined HERE, alongside the detector, so the detection
logic is a self-contained, dependency-free unit that its tests can exercise without importing
anything else. The feed (:mod:`agentforge.txline_feed`) produces these types from the wire;
the detector consumes them.
