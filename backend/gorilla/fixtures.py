"""Live fixture discovery — and the competition filter that keeps a friendly out of the demo.

``/api/fixtures/snapshot`` returns EVERY fixture TxLINE currently carries, and that set MIXES
competitions: at the time of writing it is 8 fixtures — 6 ``Friendlies`` and 2 ``World Cup``.
Taking "the first fixture" is exactly how a friendly (Vietnam v Myanmar) once got presented as
a World Cup match. So the filter is not a display concern, it is a CORRECTNESS concern and it
lives here, in one function, with a test pinning it.

:func:`world_cup_fixtures` is the only supported way to choose a fixture to watch.
