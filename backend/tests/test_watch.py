"""The signal-first ``watch`` CLI — the signal loop, exercised offline and deterministically.

No network: the scripted stream is pure synthesis and the live poller is exercised through an
injected fake feed + sleep (Pattern B). The signal is the hero; ``--act`` is the secondary
custody-gated layer. ``main`` routes ``demo`` (default) vs ``watch`` without breaking the demo.

NOTE the scripted stream and the ``SandboxExecutor`` used here are TEST fixtures, not the
operating mode: a live ``watch`` run reads the real TxLINE feed and signs with a real devnet
key. These tests pin that the offline simulation still falsifies the loop.
